Project 1:
This project is to implement the k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm, and evaluate the method on the iris data set described below. Additional questions on k-means and k-fold cross validation need to be answered and discussed.

Problem Description
The iris data set is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://mlearn.ics.uci.edu/MLRepository.html), but some changes are made for this project. The original data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each,
where each class refers to a type of iris plant. There are four numeric attributes: sepal length in cm, sepal
width in cm, petal length in cm, and petal width in cm. More detailed information can be seen in the file iris.names.
